Find the code for the Future.Works Workshop on Dash in this folder. 

This workshop is meant as a start for some nice discussions on GUIs in Python(-ish). I'm happy to continue it and hear from you.

**Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristinazappullo/).**

Have a great day and may you always find a solution on StackOverflow :grin:
